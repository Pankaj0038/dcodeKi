## About
[dcodeKi](https://github.com/Pankaj0038/dcodeKi) is a Python GUI based encoder-decoder tool using Kivy framework<p>
**Features**
- Auto copy to clipboard (everytime after encoding or decoding it automatically copy the ouput to clipboard)
- GUI
- Numerous Encoder-decoders

## Requirements
Make sure to install all the requirement in your system<br>
[Except Python you can skip downloading the other modules as I added them in the **requirements.txt** (Just follow all the installation step)]
   
1. [Python 3.7 - 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>
   **Scripting language I used to write the program**
2. [Kivy 2.2.1](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html)<br>
   **Framework to create the GUI (Graphical User Interface)**
3. [Pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/)<br>
   **Crossplatform module for the copy paste function**
4. [KivyMd 1.2.0]([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/))<br>
   **Scripting language which makes your app look more native, stylish and mobile friendly**
5. Dependency Libraries for encoders<br>
   **If the encoders (rot47, rot13, mybase64, mybase32, etc.) have external dependencies, make sure those libraries are installed**
6.KV Language File (dcodeKi.kv)<br>
   **This file defines the layout and styles for your Kivy application.**
